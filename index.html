          <h1 class="mb-4">Waveground</h1>
      <p class="lead">  The concept of a static, never changing playground is no more. Now every playground on every school looks more or less the same. There is a clear need for more challenges and dynamics for the children in their recess. Not only that, playgrounds tend to test children on a limited set of skills. Often you have to be the fastest to win, which leaves children with a visual impairment behind. We created a concept that changes everything. WaveGround.
</p>  <img class="pt-4 pb-5"src="img/Animation1.gif"><p class="lead">

The WaveGround is not just one game, it is a monthly changing world of possibilities. Every month the school gets a new game delivered for the playground. That means that WaveBlocks will be changed, software will be updated and a new game will be installed. The games are provided by us, but created in collaboration with the schools and experts in the field. We closely listen to what our clients say and even make creating games by the children theirselves a possibility.
</p>
<img class="ml-5 pl-4" src="img/inside.png" width="588" height="384"><p class="lead mt-5">
The WaveGround field has endless possibilities, because of the interchangeable WaveBlocks. These 1 by 1 meter blocks have different textures, actuators and sensors. Every block can do something different, from making sounds to extending itself a meter in height, to create fun and dynamic obstacles. This creates the possibility for very out of the box games, of which these are a few:
</p>

<h5 class="pt-7 mt-5 mb-4">Jump and match</h5>
<p class="lead">There are 3 tiles in a row, in different colors, with a slightly bigger height than the tiles surrounding them. On the other side of the grid is a row of tiles with a contrasting color to the surrounding ones. To start a new round, the children have to jump in sync on the bigger start tile. Then a sound plays. The children then have to jump on one of the 3 other tiles to hear another sound. One of the sounds is the same as the beginning sound, but the other two are similar. If they know which tile plays the correct sound, they have to “push” that tile down into the ground by jumping on it. If you do that with more people, it goes down faster, so collaboration is stimulated.
</p>
<img class="ml-1 pl-1" src="img/game1.png" width="592" height="370">
<h5 class="mt-5 mb-4">The tile orchestra</h5>
<p class="lead">All different tiles have a different color and when jumped on them, play a different sound. All the sounds are instruments, both in different tune and type. Children can work together to make music. Or when played alone, can play with a demo song, to create their own musical solo.</p>
<img class="ml-4 pl-4" src="img/game2.png" width="592" height="370">
<h5 class="mt-5 mb-4">Hidden treasure</h5>
<p class="lead">“Underneath” one of the tiles is a hidden treasure. Children can jump on a tile to hear a sound. Depending on if the sound is loud and high pitched the children can know if they are close. When the children jump onto the right tile, a tune is played and the game rests. Then a new secret location of the treasure is placed. However, there are also “bad” tiles. When jumped on, a evil sound is played and the treasure moves to a new location.

<h1 class="mb-5 mt-5">Our timeline</h1>
  <p class="lead">Last April we started working on the concept of WaveGround. Many days of refining the concept have past. We did some low fidelity prototyping, performed three interviews with experts and adjusted the concept accordingly. In June we were ready to go public and share our idea on Kickstarter. The funding period ends in August, after which we start building the first units if we achieve our financial goal. Together with a team of experienced craftsmen we will make the units safe and work seamlessly. After which we will then place the first WaveGround at the first school. We will analyze the use of the first unit to make further improvements. When we are ready, we start to manufacture on a larger scale and start to make WaveGrounds for the rest of our Kickstart-backers. After that is complete we start to work with new clients who are interested in our concept, after some evaluation and refining.
  </p>
  <img src="img/Timeline.png">
  <h1 class="mb-5 mt-5">Interviews</h1>
  <p class="lead">We performed three interviews with different teachers. One young elementary school teacher, one older teacher and a teacher from an elementary school for visually impaired children. This to get a broader view of the situation. They all told us that there is a need for change on the playground. There is namely little room for input now and all playgrounds are the same. For visually impaired children, there is little material available at the moment. Since these children experience the world and learn in a total different way, there is also a need for a playground that works in a total different way. These visually impaired children have bad motor skills because they don’t have places to train them safely. They actually like to climb and work together to go on adventure. “Children learn through watching how other children do things and then do it their selves.” A teacher said. Blind and visually impaired children like to work with sounds, since they are often very good at it. The playground should be made out of different materials with high contrast colors, this helps the children to orientate themselves and adds texture to their world. </p>
  <p class="lead mb-6 pb-6">When creating and designing the concept we took everything from the interviews into account. We created a place that can be adapted to the likings of both the children and the teachers. There is room to climb, jump and run safely. We are implementing different materials and colors and make the possibility for sound to be played from every corner. This way it is possible for everyone, no matter their vision to play together on the WaveGround.</p>

        <p class="lead">The project started around April, where all four founders met on Eindhoven University of Technology. The team was formed thanks to a common interests in shape changing technology. The interdisciplinary team, formed by two computer science and two industrial design students started their way through the process with a lot of background research that was strengthened with multiple interviews with experts. We received a lot of positive feedback and they gladly wanted to participate with our process. This made us very enthusiastic about the future of our concept: there is clearly a need for our idea. Further development is required, but the team is diverse and strong enough to take it all to the next level. For that we do need your help, because the first steps are the hardest. This was our story and we hope that you are just as enthusiastic as we are!</p>
